      <p class="desktop-padding">Jack is a New York transplant from the midwest. He works for a tech company and has a flexible work schedule that allows him to work remotely. He loves speciality coffee and often finds himself using the local coffee shop as an office. The laid
        back quite environment often envisioned when you think of coffee shops seems like a dream compared to the reality of most city based shops.</p>
      <p id="paragraph-padding">Coffee shops are usually very small, have long lines, are filled with loud conversations and phone calls. Not the ideal set upfor a productive workday. This is just one example of the challenges of accessing amazing coffee and why we knew Two Pines
        subscription based service would solve these scenarios and provide high quality fresh coffee that can be enjoyed anywhere you want.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem-section site-padding section-desktop-padding" id="two-pines-problem">
      <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
      <p class="desktop-padding">Coffee shops are in abundace but with the best shops face some of the biggest problems and challenges to its customers. </p>
      <ul id="problem-list">
        <li>Long Iines and wait times make going to a coffee shop not the greatest experience</li>
        <li>Wifi hotspots make it hard to find seating. People set up shop and take over the space</li>
        <li>High prices in store make it an expensive treat to enjoy the best roasts</li>
        <li>Too loud and noisey with converstations, cell phone usage and music</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="solution-section section-desktop-padding">
      <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
      <p class="desktop-padding">Two Pine's solution was to build a subscription based coffee service that focused on providing high quality coffee from sources that share the same values as its own brand culture. Selecting independent farmers from all over the world and building
        relationships with them to ensure we are able to give only the best product to the customers on demand at their doorsteps.</p>

        bottom level to create a conversion point for our users. The user flow was created in sketch and during the wireframing process and tested multiple times.</p>

          <p class="desktop-padding">No initial branding assets or content had been created beforehand. The process began with mind-mapping to start to establish a brand name. Once a brand name was selected we than began the logo design through sketching. We tried a few different
            angles and then did testing to help us make the decision on the logo. After iterating the logo to get the sizing and font selection right we were able to move on to typography and color palette.</p>

            and grays from where the forest and fields meet the ocean. Secondary colors will be based on lighter hues of main 3 color choices. Green backgroundcannot be used with red text vice versa due to contrast issues.</p>

            that looks great as a header font.</p>
          <p id="paragraph-padding"> I chose Raleway as my paragraph font because its a sans serif font that looks great with Bitter and the appropriateness of this project seems spot on. The fonts together create an elegant and clean style but the sans serif of Raleway still adds
            a touch of playfulness. I added a small example of text below to show how they would pair together.</p>

        <h5 id="design-h5">VISUAL DESIGN</h5>
        <p class="desktop-padding">Once the project moved into the visual design phase I used sketch as my design program of choice. I started with a layout that featured a large hero image to capture the attention of the user and begin telling the brand story. After the initial
          layout was completed I also made an alternate version that focused on capturing the customer first and focused on a sales driven approach. Both of these layouts were tested using usability hub the results proved that the sales driven approach
          would be the most effective. A final version was ready for the development phase.</p>

        the brands story as you flowed down the page.</p>

        the design process to do that. It was also about solving a real problem which is finding great coffee and being able to enjoy it at a coffee shop has become a real issue between long lines, expensive roasts and lack of space. With Two Pines subscription
        service you can enjoy the best coffee wherever and whenever you want!</p>
