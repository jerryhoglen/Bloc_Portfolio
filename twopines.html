      <h5 id="summary-padding">SUMMARY</h5>
      <p class="desktop-padding">Jack is a New York transplant from the midwest. He works for a tech company and has a flexible work schedule that allows him to work remotely. He loves speciality coffee and tends to use the local coffee shop as an office. The laid
        back quiet environment often thought of about coffee shops seems like a dream compared to the reality of most city based shops.</p>
      <p id="paragraph-padding">Coffee shops tend to be small, have long lines, and are filled with loud conversations and phone calls. Not the ideal set up for a productive workday. This is just one example of the challenges faced by people trying to enjoy the best coffee and why we knew Two Pines
        subscription based service would solve these problems and provide a high quality product that can be enjoyed anywhere you want.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem-section site-padding section-desktop-padding" id="two-pines-problem">
      <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
      <p class="desktop-padding">Coffee shops are everywhere but long lines, lack of space and a noisy atmosphere are a deterrent to enjoying a high quality product.</p>
      <ul id="problem-list">
        <li>Long lines and wait times make going to a coffee shop, not the greatest experience</li>
        <li>Wifi hotspots make it hard to find seating. People set up shop and take over the space</li>
        <li>High prices in store make it an expensive treat to enjoy the best roasts</li>
        <li>Too loud and noisy with converstations, cell phone usage and music</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="solution-section section-desktop-padding">
      <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
      <p class="desktop-padding">Two Pine's solution was to build a subscription-based coffee service that focuses on providing high-quality coffee from sources that share the same values as its own brand culture. Selecting independent farmers from all over the world and building
        relationships with them to ensure we are able to give only the best product to the customers on demand at their doorsteps.</p>

Kennedy wants accessible coffee so she can get away from the lack of seating and noise at her local coffee
        shops. Regina is an NYC based web designer who needs the fuel of the caffeine to get through her busy days but the hefty price is putting a dent in her wallet.</p>

      <p class="desktop-padding">Surveys were completed to determine the flow of the site. Since it was going to be a single page website we wanted to make sure that the flow from top to bottom followed what the user wants. We added the subscribe button at top, mid, and
        bottom level to create a conversion point for our users. The user flow was created in sketch during the wireframing process and tested multiple times.</p>

          <h5>BRANDING</h5>
          <p class="desktop-padding">No branding assets or content had been created beforehand. The process began with mind-mapping to start to establish a brand name. Once a brand name was selected we then began the logo design by sketching. We tried a few different
            angles and then did testing to help us make the decision on the logo. After iterating the logo to get the sizing and font selection right we were able to move on to typography and color palette.</p>

        <div class="color-palette-grid">
          <h5>Color Pallete</h5>
          <p>Bold and classic. The color palette was chosen with the intentions of using minimal choices but focusing on bold classic combinations that are influenced by the New England Culture. Inspiration was drawn from the green pines to the dark blues
            and grays from where the forest and fields meet the ocean. Secondary colors will be based on lighter hues of main 3 color choices. The green background cannot be used with red text vice versa due to contrast issues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="typography-grid">
          <h5>Typography</h5>
          <p class="desktop-padding">For my font pairing I chose Meta Pro for the header font and Tisa Pro for paragraph text. FF Meta is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Erik Spiekermann in 1991. The design features a large x-height, open apertures and a “l” with a tail that helps distinguish it from a “1” or uppercase “i”—these features help to enhance its legibility. I chose this font because the humanist aspect of its characters really helps to bring together that small town feel of the people of Two Pines.</p>
          <p id="paragraph-padding">FF Tisa is a serif typeface created by Slovenian designer Mitja Miklavčič in 2006. FF Tisa has a large x-height which offers it excellent legibility. I think it’s a great choice for setting long passages of text on the web. The serif characters read like a classic book. It helps to create the historical feel and ties perfect with its Meta Pro partner.</p>

        <h5 id="design-h5">VISUAL DESIGN</h5>
        <p class="desktop-padding">Once the project moved into the visual design phase I used sketch as my design program of choice. I started with a layout that featured a large hero image to capture the attention of the user and begin telling the brand story. After the initial layout was completed I also made an alternate version that tried to convert the customer first and took a sales driven approach. Both of these layouts were tested using usability hub the results proved that the sales driven approach would be the most effective. A final version was ready for the development phase.</p>

        the brands story as you flowed down the page.</p>

      <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
      <p class="desktop-padding">Two Pines product showcase wasn’t about building a visually appealing website that would show some coffee packaging. It was about creating and inventing a brand that had a real story behind it that would connect its users to the brand through empathy and use
        the design process to do that. It was also about solving a real problem which is finding great coffee and being able to enjoy it at a coffee shop has become a real issue between long lines, expensive roasts and lack of space. With Two Pines subscription
        service you can enjoy the best coffee wherever and whenever you want!</p>
