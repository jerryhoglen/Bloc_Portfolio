      <h5 id="summary-padding">SUMMARY</h5>
      <p id="queued-p">Jane loves to have dinner parties and make playlists for the event. Her friends often complain about her taste in music, they always ask to her to play certain tracks or to "switch it up". They talk about the good old days when you could use a jukebox
        and everyone could hear what they wanted to hear and get a turn. They think music applications are so complicated to use and none of them let your guests add to the queue but not anymore! This is just one example a frustration that led to the
        creation of Queued.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem-section site-padding section-desktop-padding" id="two-pines-problem">
      <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
      <p class="desktop-padding">Music applications lack the ability to give your guests control and let everyone experience the fun. </p>
      <ul id="problem-list">
        <li>Applications are too complicated to meet the needs of wide age groups that aren't used to technology</li>
        <li>Most applications are missing the option to queue music to a playlist</li>
        <li>Technology is forcing people to be less engaged with each other in the music market</li>
        <li>You have to create an account or have a subscription for most applications</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="solution-section section-desktop-padding">
      <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
      <p class="desktop-padding">Queued is a music application that allows the host to create a party playlist and give the guests the party passcode. The host will choose either engaged mode which allows users to add songs and then like or dislike them. If a song is disliked more
        than it is liked before the current playing song ends then that song will me moved to the end of the queue. The second mode is classic mode and it functions just like a classic jukebox. If a song is added to the queue then it will be played in
        the order it was added. The host can determine how many songs a guest can add per hour and is the only one that can delete songs from the queue.</p>

      <h5>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h5>
      <p class="desktop-padding">The music application market is dominated by many recognizable names like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, and Amazon Music services however, the largest companies all lack the ability to allow guests to queue music to one curated playlist at the
        same time. There are 3 popular companies that are currently doing various versions of this but all lack either key features or easy to user interfaces. Check out my full analysis to see how I identified a way to break into a competitive market.</p>

        user flows.</p>

      <p class="desktop-padding" id="user-story-p">Now that I had a mapped out user flow I continued on in the process and built out a sitemap so I had a skeleton structure to begin creating wireframes and artboards. The application will have a host and guest path that the user's can take so the
        sitemap below represents those two paths broken into screens.</p>

            helped me come up with the name Queued and then through sketching and many iterations the logo was created.</p>

          <h5>Color Palette</h5>
          <p>Color selection was kept limited due to screen size and the fact that album artwork would take up most of the screen and I didn't want to take away from the simplicit design. Pops of color are used for the buttons and to highlight the logo.</p>

      <p class="testing-paragraph desktop-padding">Queued came from an idea a friend and I had and we thought that others felt the same way but we didn't have proof that this was the case until we began research. An initial survey was created to identify if users felt the same pain points we felt
        about the music application market and if there was a need for another music app. Based on the results of our initial survey we recognized the need and potential market so we created a competitive analysis to further research the market.

      <p class="desktop-padding">This is the first prototype that was created for Queued. After whiteboarding with post it notes to create user flows I wanted to get screens together to get a real world feel for the flow of the application. This was tested with a small group and
        early opportunities were identified and adjusted as I continued testing.</p>

      <p class="desktop-padding">This prototype was built out taking a different approach to iOS design and based on user feedback it didn't feel native enough and I decided to stick to what user's were comfortable with and built the app as close to native iOS guidelines as possible
        but maintain it's own uniqueness that would be recognizable.</p>

      <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
      <p class="desktop-padding">Queued was the first mobile application I have designed and I learned how important testing is in application development. The complexity of keeping the experience as simple as possible and priortizing all of the user's need is a challenging task. In the world we live in today user's are delivered so much information on a daily basis. Technology often increases the complexity when taking a real world object and turning it into a mobile application. A jukebox was a huge object but it did what it was designed to do well. Our goal was to take that classic memory and update it to meet the needs of a variety of users today and not take away from its simplicity and I believe I accomplished that goal. Queued puts the party in the guests hands so they can make memories that will last forever and experience it with each other.</p>
