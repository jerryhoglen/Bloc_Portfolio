      <p class="desktop-padding">Jane loves to have dinner parties and make playlists for the event. Her friends often complain about her taste in music, they always ask to her to play certain tracks or to "switch it up". They talk about the good old days when you could use a jukebox
        and everyone could hear what they wanted to hear and get a turn. They think music applications are so complicated to use and none of them let your guests add to the queue but not anymore! This is just one example a frustration that led to the
        creation of Queued.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem-section site-padding section-desktop-padding" id="two-pines-problem">
      <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
      <p class="desktop-padding">Music applications lack the ability to give your guests control and let everyone experience the fun. </p>
      <ul id="problem-list">
        <li>Applications are too complicated to meet the needs of wide age groups that aren't used to technology</li>
        <li>Most applications are missing the option to queue music to a playlist</li>
        <li>Technology is forcing people to be less engaged with each other in the music market</li>
        <li>You have to create an account or have a subscription for most applications</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="solution-section section-desktop-padding">
      <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
      <p class="desktop-padding">Queued is a music application that allows the host to create a party playlist and give the guests the party passcode. The host will choose either engaged mode which allows users to add songs and then like or dislike them. If a song is disliked more
        than it is liked before the current playing song ends then that song will me moved to the end of the queue. The second mode is classic mode and it functions just like a classic jukebox. If a song is added to the queue then it will be played in
        the order it was added. The host can determine how many songs a guest can add per hour and is the only one that can delete songs from the queue.</p>

          <p class="desktop-padding">No branding assets or content had been created beforehand. The process began with mind-mapping to start to establish a brand name. Once a brand name was selected we then began the logo design by sketching. We tried a few different angles and
            then did testing to help us make the decision on the logo. After iterating the logo to get the sizing and font selection right we were able to move on to typography and color palette.</p>

          <h5>Color Pallete</h5>
          <p>Bold and classic. The color palette was chosen with the intentions of using minimal choices but focusing on bold classic combinations that are influenced by the New England Culture. Inspiration was drawn from the green pines to the dark blues
            and grays from where the forest and fields meet the ocean. Secondary colors will be based on lighter hues of main 3 color choices. The green background cannot be used with red text vice versa due to contrast issues.</p>

        <div class="typography-grid">
          <h5>Typography</h5>
          <p class="desktop-padding">For my font pairing I chose Meta Pro for the header font and Tisa Pro for paragraph text. FF Meta is a humanist sans-serif typeface designed by Erik Spiekermann in 1991. The design features a large x-height, open apertures and a “l” with a tail
            that helps distinguish it from a “1” or uppercase “i”—these features help to enhance its legibility. I chose this font because the humanist aspect of its characters really helps to bring together that small town feel of the people of Two Pines.</p>
          <p id="paragraph-padding">FF Tisa is a serif typeface created by Slovenian designer Mitja Miklavčič in 2006. FF Tisa has a large x-height which offers it excellent legibility. I think it’s a great choice for setting long passages of text on the web. The serif characters
            read like a classic book. It helps to create the historical feel and ties perfect with its Meta Pro partner.</p>

        <h5 id="design-h5">VISUAL DESIGN</h5>
        <p class="desktop-padding">Once the project moved into the visual design phase I used sketch as my design program of choice. I started with a layout that featured a large hero image to capture the attention of the user and begin telling the brand story. After the initial
          layout was completed I also made an alternate version that tried to convert the customer first and took a sales driven approach. Both of these layouts were tested using usability hub the results proved that the sales driven approach would be
          the most effective. A final version was ready for the development phase.</p>

      <p class="desktop-padding">Two Pines product showcase wasn’t about building a visually appealing website that would show some coffee packaging. It was about creating and inventing a brand that had a real story behind it that would connect its users to the brand through empathy
        and use the design process to do that. It was also about solving a real problem which is finding great coffee and being able to enjoy it at a coffee shop has become a real issue between long lines, expensive roasts and lack of space. With Two
        Pines subscription service you can enjoy the best coffee wherever and whenever you want!</p>
