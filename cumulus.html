    <h5>SUMMARY</h5>
    <p>Sara is a new mom struggling to balance raising her baby, working a 9-5 job and trying to build her side hustle into a business. She is smart, creative but not the most tech savy. Managing and organizing everything in her life is scattered across
      web browsers, note pads and applications. She dreams of the day when technology will help her organize her beautiful mess and allow her to access all her information in one place from any device at anytime. That was our goal when building Cumulus
      and we believe we created the solution Sara has always wanted.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="problem-section site-padding">
    <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
    <p>There are many software programs, websites and apps that allow users to save notes, images and links but none that can achieve all of these goals and be user friendly. Some of the problems we found when conducting research were.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Most users have multiple apps and sites they use to access their information, this makes it difficult to find the information they need quickly</li>
      <li>2. Storing information requires using passwords and usernames which can be hard to track and remember when usings multiples apps and software</li>
      <li>3. People want access to information at all times whether online or offline and not many solutions are out there</li>
      <li>4. Keeping track of bookmarks between web browsers is hard enough, when you add in multiple devices trying to access that information it becomes almost impossible.
      </li>
      <li>5. Users want access to all their content in one place</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="solution-section site-padding">
    <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
    <img src="images/cumulusimac.png" alt="cumulus gif example" />
    <p>Cumulus’ solution to this problem was to design and build a platform that allows its user’s to save all types of content such images, links and notes and creates boxes that can categorize the information however the user wants. Another great feature
      of Cumulus is its’s users ability to share and collaborate with each other in real time from any device.</p>

      <p>Use their phones as the first place they begin their searches for news, social and entertainment.p>

      <li><img src="images/pinterestlogo.png" /></li>
      <li><img src="images/evernotelogo.png" /></li>
    </ul>
    <p>My competitive analysis was done with Dropbox, Pinterest and Evernote. Individually these applications have some really great features and I believe what’s missing in the market is application that combine’s a lot of these features in one application.
      My goal was to build an application that took a lot of those features to the next level. I wanted to focus on a product that will allow the user to save information, share information and collaborate with their teams in a seamless way on any device.
      The product should have key features such as easy file upload, the ability to share information with share buttons, and collaborate in real time so if a user updates from their device the information is accessible immediately. Some nice to have
      features would be browser extensions that allows users to save with one click to Cumulus as well as a simple drag and drop file upload.</p>

    <p>Three users were tested and personas were created. Alex wants access to her information from any device. John really wants to be able to collect and group images, colors and websites together to build better inspiration boards. Kaylie lives on social
      media and the web, she finds it hard to keep track of all the information she collects and wants one application to store everything.</p>

  <div class="wireframing-section site-padding">
    <h5>WIREFRAMING</h5>
    <p>Initial wireframing was done using Balsamiq. I chose Balsamiq because of its handdrawn look and feel. This allowed me to focus on the content layout versus page styling. I created the initial homepage, dashboard, blank state, account settings page,
      add billing screen and upload image modal window.</p>
    <h5>Homepage</h5>
    <img src="images/balsamiqhomepage.png" alt="" />
    <h5>Dashboard</h5>

    <a href="" class="btn">View Balsamiq Wireframes</a>
    <h5>BLACK AND WHITE WIREFRAMING</h5>
    <p>After the first round of wireframes were completed I then began to create lo fidelity black and white wireframes in Adobe Illustrator. This helped to bring the layout to life and understand how the content blocks would flow together. I created 30
      artboards for all of the various screens that would be used in the web application before I began user testing in Invision.</p>

    <h5>USER TESTING</h5>
    <h5>Prototyping</h5>
    <p>Once the Illustrator wireframes were completed I exported the artboards over to Invision and built out a lo fidelity prototype for my users to began testing against the user flows we had created. We received mostly positive feedback on the layout of the site. One opportunity we found was the size of CTA buttons being to small so adjusted those and moved on to the visual design of the site.</p>

  <div class="visual-design-section site-padding">
    <h5>VISUAL DESIGN</h5>
    <p>After I adjusted the opportunities from the prototype feedback I felt confident about beginning the visual design processs in Sketch. I took my illustrator files combined with the style guide and made the screens in Sketch. I built out 22 artboards to ensure all screens were accounted for so I could create another Invision prototype for further testing.</p>

  <div class="user-testing-2-section site-padding">
    <h5>USER TESTING II</h5>
    <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
    <p>I used Usability Hub to complete further testing. I had users complete a five
second test, a preference test and a navigation test. We helped us really focus on
the user experience challenges before we moved on to the visual design of the
site.</p>
    <h5>Five Second Test</h5>
    <p>I created a five second test that focused on the landing page layout. The goal of
the five second test was to see if users would be able to gain trust of the brand,
easily identify what the brand’s intention is, and if the content’s featured met our
goals.</p>
    <a href="" class="btn">View Five Second Test</a>
    <h5>Preference Test</h5>
    <p>I created a preference test for an add button on the dashboard interface. I kept the add button on the left nav window in both screens. On the second screen I added an additional Add button to the top right of the dashboard for users to be able to add a new box with or without the left nav window opened. 100% of the users chose the additional Add button so I kept that in the final design.</p>

    <a href="" class="btn">View Preference Test</a>
    <h5>Navigation Test</h5>
    <p>I created a navigation flow test on the dashboard as well after I added the new
add button to ensure placement was in the best place for the user. Below you can
see the heat map from the user clicks on the button showing the positive results of
the placement of the button.</p>

  <div class="development-section site-padding">
    <h5>DEVELOPMENT</h5>
    <p>The web prototype was completely coded by myself. It was coded in Atom Editor
using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I chose to use CSS Grid Layout for this website
to show my coding skills and because I wanted to challenge myself to use a new
tool that is actively growing in the development community. The site is being
hosted on Github and I used Iterm 2 as my terminal to push the code to Github.
You can view the web prototype below and also check out my github profile to
review the code.</p>

  <div class="conclusion site-padding">
    <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
    <p>Cumulus was created with the goal of solving an issue that impacts so many
people today. The constant struggle between usings old tools like pen and paper,
web browsers and software programs has made it challenging for users to be
efficient and productive. We sought out to solve those problems in one
application. I believe based on user testing, multiple iterations and positive
feedback we received throughout that process that we have created a tool that
will positively impact users like Sara and allow teams to accomplish their goals.</p>
