  <div class="bio-summary">
    <p class="bold">I am a solution oriented problem solver. Telling a story through my design process that always prioritizes the end user is what I have learned and focused on while gaining experience in the UX/UI design field. I am committed to always challenging myself and constantly iterating through the process to build upon the foundation I have.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In my current career, I had the opportunity to work on a product team developing an app for a retail store that would help track and move inventory between the sales floor and stockroom. This is where I was first exposed to UX design and web development. Being part of that experience really influenced my decision to pursue a new path where I could build upon my skillsets and use my experience. One of my greatest skills as a leader has always been to break the business down into components where we could create solutions and solve problems that would impact the overall business without changing the entire process and is very in line with the UX process. </p>
    <br>
    <p>This is what has attracted me to web design and I have been focused on learning the design process and incorporating my previous experience as much as possible. I have spent the past year and a half enrolled in web development and design programs to gain the knowledge and ability to work in the industry. I have completed the <span style="font-weight:900">Full Stack Web Development Program</span> through Careerfoundry, the <span style="font-weight:900">Javascript Intensive Program</span> at General Assembly and am currently enrolled in the <span style="font-weight:700">Designer Track Apprenticeship</span> through Bloc.</p>
